# gametest
Hi, I completed this coding test.
All the tests are passed and I used Spring Boot Configuration to define the End point for Get Average Price for the 
Guitar type.
To test the end point please run the below command from the root folder of the project.

command : mvn spring-boot:run

end point to hit: http://localhost:8080/interview-test/guitar-shop/get-average-price?type=classic

Assumptions: If no type specified, i considered classic as default one.

Thanks,
Sekhar.
